# Wallpaper

The [Irvie wallpaper](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/irvue/id1039633667?mt=12) is one of my favourite apps but at my current work, the IT department has disabled custom wallpapers.

I could ask them to lift this ban for me since I work from home and there is no reason for the company logo to sit as my wallpaper.

I could... but I'd rather use this as inspiration to build with Electron and try their new [forge](https://www.electronforge.io/).

The goal would be create a window that would sit the background and behave like a wallpaper.
