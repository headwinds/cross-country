# Blockbuilder

### Vanity Search

Blockbuilder was very important to me while I was learning D3 & SVG. It was incredibly inspiring to explore all the blocks by top data visualizaton experts.

Today, we would sign up for [observable](https://observablehq.com/).

- [Blockbuilder Search Data](https://observablehq.com/@enjalot/blockbuilder-search-data)
- [perplexity convo](https://www.perplexity.ai/search/i-have-a-large-blocks-json-fil-7jbhxU6nTY.LacvYHWyWVQ#1)

I added my local blocks.json to .gitignore as its over 100 MB but you can also grab it from the [site](https://observablehq.com/@enjalot/blockbuilder-search-data)).
