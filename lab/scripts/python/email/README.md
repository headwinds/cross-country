# Email

experimenting with Python and the Gmail API to better manage emails that I sent to myself.

The "share with" functionality is challenging to build and with the approach, I can use gmail as a tank and pump content in and out of it.

emails.json is from Python

## Anyquery

I used [anyquery](https://anyquery.dev/) and a nice interaction on their [discussion board](https://github.com/julien040/anyquery/discussions/15)

emails_sent_to_self.json is from anyquery before they made the update to include the body.
