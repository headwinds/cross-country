### Install

```
npm install cross-country
```

### Use

```
import { Column, Row, Paragraph, Table, Chart } from "cross-country"
```

### NextJS Support

For this third-party library to work within NextJS, there is one change required to import it's single css bundle.

Edit the \_app.js file to:

```
import type { Metadata } from "next";
import { Inter } from "next/font/google";
import "./globals.css";
import "cross-country/dist/bundle.css";
import { GoogleAnalytics } from "@next/third-parties/google";
```

### Tailwind CSS Support

Each component provides a `customClass` propertity where you can supply your own tailwind css classes.

### Example Page

By wrapping html, each component is augmented for building accessible experiences across screens. A simple page may look like this:

```
<Wrapper>
  <Page>
    <Column>
      <Paragraph>
       Hello! I'm a developer with a mix of frontend and backend experience.
      </Paragraph>
      <Metrics keyValuePairs=[{label: "Frontend", value: 75, type: "percent"}, {label: "Backend", value: 25, type: "percent"}] />
    </Column>
  </Page>
  <Wallpaper />
</Wrapper>
```

## Server Side Rendering

Part of my dogfooding process is to use my library on my own site, [headwinds](https://headwinds.vercel.app).

Initially, I ran into a build error where I had to account for every `window` and `document` ensuring that they are not referenced until the UI hits the client. After hunting through my webpack build file, I was ble to eliminate them all, and it now works 100% server side!

## Unsplash Config

Before installing, create a cross-country-config-private.js file in your root directory by copying the cross-country-config.js and renaming it.

```
export const privateConfig = {
  UNSPLASH_API_KEY: 'YOUR-UNSPLASH-KEY',
};
```

## Storybook

While creating compoents, you can use Storybook

```
npm run storybook
```

Open your browser to http://localhost:6006/

## Build the Static Site for Storybook

After running `npm run build-storybook`, I had to make one change to the iframe.html file in the storybook-static folder.

The bundle.css isn't added so I had to add it manually.

```
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="./bundle.css" />
```

## Before Publishing Check Types

```
npx tsc --noEmit
```

## Publish to NPM

Update the version number before publishing via `npm version patch`

```
npm login
your-username-not-your-email
your-password
now-your-email
npm publish
```
