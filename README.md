The componennts within this library are designed responsively to be used write articles and create tile-based games; even better combine writing, gaming, with a sample dataset and tell a story.

Are you a fan of the Sims, Starcraft, Chess, Dumgeons and Dragons and other table top games? Do you keep a sketch book and draw notes about games, and the general puzzles that make up life? This library is meant to translate your analog sketch book pages into a digital works that can be shared and explored by other like-minded individuals. 

By wrapping html, each component is augmented for building accessible experiences across screens. A simple page may look like this:

```
<Wrapper>
  <Page>
    <Column>
      <Paragraph>

## Usage

```jsx
import React, { Component } from 'react'
import {Column, Row, Image, Headline, Paragraph, Wolf} from 'cross-country';

const data = {
  headline: "My world needs another design system",
  image: {
    url: "https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1512411233342-92208dfe81af?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&ixid=eyJhcHBfaWQiOjEyMDd9&auto=format&fit=crop&w=934&q=80",
    a11y: "a nice aframe from unsplash",
    width: 300
  },
  wolf: {
    url: "https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1512411233342-92208dfe81af?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&ixid=eyJhcHBfaWQiOjEyMDd9&auto=format&fit=crop&w=934&q=80",
    text: "K-2SO & Jyn Erso" 
    a11y: "K-2SO & Jyn Erso"
}

const {headline, wolf, image } = data;

const App = () => (
      <Column>
          <Headline text={headline} />
          <Row>
            <Image {...image} />
            <Column>
              <Wolf config={wolf} />
            </Column>
          </Row>
        </Column>
    )
export default App; 
```

All the components are stateless functions. They do not use any state hooks. Your project's components will control the state, and you simply pass in the desire state change to each component to update them.
