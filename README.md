[![NPM](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/cross-country.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cross-country) [![JavaScript Style Guide](https://img.shields.io/badge/code_style-standard-brightgreen.svg)](https://standardjs.com)

Are you a fan of the Sims, Starcraft, Chess, Dumgeons and Dragons and other table top role playing games aka TTRPGs? 

Do you keep a sketch book and draw notes about games, and the general puzzles that make up life? 

This library is meant to translate your analog sketch book pages into a digital works that can be shared and explored by other like-minded individuals. Ultimately, could we combine both analog and digital into some new mixed AR/VR experience?!

The components within this library are designed responsively to be used write articles and create tile-based games; even better combine writing, gaming, with a sample dataset and tell a story.

By wrapping html, each component is augmented for building accessible experiences across screens. A simple page may look like this:

```
<Wrapper>
  <Page>
    <Column>
      <Paragraph>

       A simple page may look like this with the default design settings.
      </Paragraph>
    </Column>
    <Column>
      <MyGameOrExperiementHere />
    </Column>
  </Page>
  <Wallpaper />

- scss modules
- D3 
- Storybook

## Install

```
yarn add cross-country
```
or
```
npm install --save cross-country
```

You want to open 2 terminals

Terminal 1. where you build the components
```
yarn start
```

Terminal 2. where you can play with the components via Storybook
```
yarn storybook
```

Open your browser to http://localhost:6006/

To build & deploy storybook `yarn build-storybook`

3. Example - you will need to link the library - if link fail, everything in the example is also available in the storybook
```
cd example
yarn start 
```

Open your browser to http://localhost:3000/

In order to use React Hooks, you will also have to [link react](https://stackoverflow.com/a/58612244/581803) or you will get a rule of hooks error.

If we see: Error: Invalid hook call. Hooks can only be called inside of the body

run:

```
npm link example/node_modules/react
```

You may need to stop and restart both library and example folders.


## Usage

```jsx
import React, { Component } from 'react'
import {Column, Row, Image, Headline, Paragraph, Wolf} from 'cross-country';

const data = {
  headline: "My world needs another design system",
  image: {
    url: "https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1512411233342-92208dfe81af?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&ixid=eyJhcHBfaWQiOjEyMDd9&auto=format&fit=crop&w=934&q=80",
    a11y: "a nice aframe from unsplash",
    width: 300
  },
  wolf: {
    url: "https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1512411233342-92208dfe81af?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&ixid=eyJhcHBfaWQiOjEyMDd9&auto=format&fit=crop&w=934&q=80",
    text: "K-2SO & Jyn Erso" 
    a11y: "K-2SO & Jyn Erso"
}

const {headline, wolf, image } = data;

const App = () => (
      <Column>
          <Headline text={headline} />
          <Row>
            <Image {...image} />
            <Column>
              <Wolf config={wolf} />
            </Column>
          </Row>
        </Column>
    )
