# Cross Country

<Subtitle>explore the cross section of games and data visualization</Subtitle>

Have you ever wanted to bring a sketch into a game? Do you doodle games in your notebook and want to quick prototype them? Do you want to share common, end to end components like a login or chat across applications? Cross Country is a library designed to make this happen, and encourages the exploration of social science, tile-based games and machine learning.
