      <Paragraph>This is my component library. It is both personal and public. I like the "building in public" movement and wanted to share some experiments. I wanted to treat Storybook like a blog. Many of these components are unfinished and developed in a few hours just for fun. I am under no commercial pressure to polish or perfect them but do want to eventually prune this library and keep the best ones.

       <Paragraph>
        What is a perfect component anyways? To me, it has a single purpose; it is composable and well-tested. It often arrives at my idea of  perfection after many rounds of iteration and interaction. It feels rigid/hardened and thus perfect.

      <Paragraph>
      In many cases, these components are far more complicated than I would encounter building Enterprise applications. They provide both practice and confidence; that if I can conquer these puzzles my day job should be a breeze! Of course, I have full control here where Enterprise dev is more about wrestling with and grokking foreign systems.

      <Paragraph>
        Along with a personal website, I thought it would be fun to produce a personal storybook and component library that explores UI, game mechanics, AI and data visualization. I'm not sure what this will become, but I'm excited to see where it goes. It's all about the journey.

      <Paragraph>Why do I need my own component library? Why can't I just use an established one? In my professional life, I do reach for open source component libraries like Material UI.</Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>But in order to play and become a mechanic of code, I need to build my own. I need to understand the fundamentals of how components work.</Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>Have you ever wanted to bring a sketch into a game? Do you doodle games in your notebook and want to quick prototype them? Do you want to share common, end to end components like a login or chat across applications? Cross Country is a library designed to make this happen, and encourages the exploration of social science, tile-based games and machine learning. </Paragraph>
