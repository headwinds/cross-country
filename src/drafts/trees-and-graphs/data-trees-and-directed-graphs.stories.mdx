<Subtitle>Trees & Graphs</Subtitle>

<Paragraph>
  We can organize data into trees and graphs to provide structure. They are both used to represent data in a
  hierarchical way. The difference is that trees can be considered a type of graph which specific rules that the data
  flows from root down. While all tress are graphs, the opposite is not true: not all graphs are trees.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
  A graph is not a tree when the data doesn't all flow in the same in the direction from parent to child. There may be a
  cycle in the data or a child may point back to the parent.
</Paragraph>

<SubHeadline>Trees</SubHeadline>

<Paragraph>
  When using a text editor like Meta's <Link url="https://lexical.dev/">lexical</Link>, we can create a tree by nesting
  bullet points. This is a parent-child relationship. The parent is the bullet point and the child is the nested bullet
  point. The parent is the root of the tree and the child is the leaf. The tree is a type of graph known as a Directed
  Acyclic Graph (DAG) because the data flows from the root to the leaf and there are no cycles.
</Paragraph>{' '}

<Paragraph>
  How can we convert tabular data into a tree? What fields would this table need to express the parent-child
  relationship?
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
  While a computer can easily take a string a html of display a webpage, humans are more visual builders and prefer to
  view the html as a tree in an editor like VS Code or Submlime while we work on it.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>For instance, take this instruction list string of html as a row:</Paragraph>

```
const instructionList = [
    {indent: 0, text: "Build a Backyard Office", type: "h1"},
    {indent: 1, text: "scout your backyard", type: "ol"},
    {indent: 1, text: "convince your partner", type: "ol"},
    {indent: 2, text: "measure the available space", type: "ol"},
    {indent: 0, text: "Do more steps and then enjoy your shed", type: "p"}
]
```

```
<div><ul><li>scout your backyard</li><li>design the shed</li><ol><li>measure the available space</li><li>sketch the layout</li></ol><li>source materials</li></ul></div>
```

<SubHeadline>Graphs</SubHeadline>

<Paragraph>
  When a child node points back to the parent, it is no longer considered a tree but a graph. This is because the data
  flows in both directions. This is a Directed Graph (DG). By examining the complexity of our visualization, we can see
  that our graph is either sparse or dense.{' '}
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
  When harvesting D3 scripts from <Link url="https://bl.ocks.org/">Bl.ocks</Link> or{' '}
  <Link url="https://observablehq.com/">Observerable</Link>, you may discover that they do a lot in each function. Any
  time you see long functions, this is an opportunity to refactor and make it easier to maintain. These long functions
  are basically pipelines that assemble the final visualization.
