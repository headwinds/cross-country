# Monthly Review

<Subtitle>...</Subtitle>

In my UI sketchbook, goal setting design is a theme I keep returning to. What is my ideal candence for personal reflection where I write out goals and mark their progress.

Last year (2022) was the first year that I attempted to document my majorly accomplishments for the month. I fairly faithful to this activity in that I had I believe I do so 10 out of the 12 months. One month I had to make up for and the other I wasn't inclined to do so. Why did I lose the motivation?

2022 was also the third year in a row where I ran at least 5kms every week. This streak ended in January of this year (2023).
