# Thumbnail Gallery

<Subtitle>A stateless component.</Subtitle>

This is a stateless component where you need to pass an array of thumbnails and handlers to manage the thumbnail selection.

It is desktop breakpoint exclusive so if you resize the screen to tablet or mobile it will disappear.

For tablet or mobile, you would probably want to use the Dots navigation component.

It is currently used within the ProductImageSection component found on the PDP.
