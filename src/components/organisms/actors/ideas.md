# Actors

## Actor Generator 

After building the Hunter, I manually created the Wizard, Cleric & Warrior by copying the Hunter folder and renaming the files.

I should be able to take the generate-component script to automate this process or I wonder if I can turn it a UI with database records? 

What fields would an actor table have? It would be fun to develop an actor creator/editor! You could either start with a blank actor or fork a template. How could templates be combined like in D&D to create multi-class characters?
