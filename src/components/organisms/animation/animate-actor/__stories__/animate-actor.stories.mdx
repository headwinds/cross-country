<Headline text="Scripting Animation with react-spring" />

<Paragraph>
  I've selected <Link url="https://www.react-spring.dev/">react-spring</Link> as the animation library for native html
  tags because I like how it is Physics based. I really enjoyed exploring the Box2D physics engine; it did such an
  amazing job of collision detection; but it's just not practical for building interface animations.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
  I actually believe <Link url="https://greensock.com/gsap/">GSAP</Link> as has an easier API for beginners but there is
  something more compelling about react-spring.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>What if I could combine the ease of GSAP's API with the physics of react-spring?</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
  I'll look at the various pieces that make up a complex animation breaking them down into individual commands like
  moveUp or moveDown so that we can eventually chain the commands together.
</Paragraph>

<SubHeadline text="Simple Animation with useSpringRef and a command" />

<Paragraph>
  The <Link url="https://www.react-spring.dev/docs/concepts/imperative-api">Imperative API</Link> will control the
  animation without re-rendering the component. useSpringRef provides a hook and the ability to add multiple controllers
  to a single ref.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
  You can think of each component on the screen as an actor. We want to design meaningful animations that enchance the
  interaction. Typically, in UI design, you see text animated.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
  Similar to D3, useTransition has the same concept where by removing elements from the array will trigger the leave
  animation. I would hazard a guess that D3 may have even inspired this API since they both use data as the array name.
</Paragraph>

<SubHeadline text="SpringValue" />

<Paragraph>
  By learning about <Link url="https://www.react-spring.dev/docs/advanced/spring-value">SpringValue</Link>, we can
  better understand how to manipulate the animation over time.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>Speaking of time, how can we controll how long or how short the animation is?</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
  Since React-spring is physics-based, the time is controlled via the physical properties set in the{' '}
  <Link url="https://react-spring.dev/docs/advanced/config">spring configs.</Link>
</Paragraph>

<AnimateActorUseSpringRef />

<Paragraph>
  In this example, there doesn't seem to be much need for useSpringRef but I'm hoping that by using it here, it will
  eventually make it easier to chain commands together.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
  Within the props, each property is a SpringValue so it get the value of each one we need to use get()
</Paragraph>

<pre>
  <code className="language-javascript">
    {`
const springRef = useSpringRef();
  const [isDisabled, setDisabled] = useState(false);

  const [props, api] = useSpring(
    () => ({
      ref: springRef,
      from: { x: 0, y: 0, z: 0 },
    }),
    []
  );

  const moveRight = distance => {
    const { x, y, z } = props;
    const curX = x.get();
    const newDistanceRight = curX + distance;
    const to = { x: newDistanceRight };

    api.start({
      to,
      onStart: () => console.log('the spring has started'),
      onChange: () => console.log('the spring has frame changed'),
      onRest: () => console.log('the spring has reached rest'),
      onPause: () => console.log('the spring has paused'),
      onResume: () => console.log('the spring has resumed'),
    });
  };

  const move = direction => {
    moveRight(100);
  };

  const handleClick = () => {
    if (!isDisabled) {
      const { x, y, z } = props;
      // limit the space that the actor can move
      if (x.get() <= 100) {
        move();
      }
    }
    setDisabled(true);
  };
`}

<SubHeadline text="Events" />

<Paragraph>
  By watching the <Link url="https://www.react-spring.dev/docs/advanced/events">events</Link>, we could build more
  complex animations. For instance, once the has animation has come to a rest, we move to another location.
</Paragraph>

<SubHeadline text="useChain" />

<Paragraph>
  But there is an easier way to accomplish this orchestration. We can review the docs for{' '}
  <Link url="https://react-spring.dev/docs/components/use-chain">chain</Link> and{' '}
  <Link url="https://react-spring.dev/docs/advanced/async-animations">async animations</Link> to script the commands.
</Paragraph>

<AnimateActorUseChain />

<Paragraph>
  Alright, that's cool but how do we break out of animation around responsd to an event? Again we turn to{' '}
  <Link url="https://react-spring.dev/docs/advanced/async-animations">async animations</Link> guide and this time use
  the supplied cancel function.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>Let's build an animation where our Warrior is patrolling the castle grounds.</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
  While docs show that we can pass a cancel function, I don't see how I can access nor use it effectively. Instead, and
  possibly easier, let's simply use the pause and resume api functions to achieve the same results.
</Paragraph>

<AnimateActorPatrol />

<Paragraph>
  At first, I thought I could useState for the counter but after trying it and observing that the associated re-render
  can negatively affect the running animtion. Then, I used a simple let counter within the move function.
</Paragraph>

<pre>
  <code className="language-javascript">
    {`
const move = distance => {
    const { x, y, z } = props;
    const curX = x.get();
    const curY = y.get();
    const newDistanceRight = curX + distance;
    const newDistanceDown = curY + distance;
    const newDistanceLeft = newDistanceRight - distance;
    const newDistanceUp = newDistanceDown - distance;

    let count = 0; // had to use a simple let as useState seems to affect the animation restarting it!

    const onRest = () => {
      count = count < 4 ? count + 1 : 0;
      setWarriorReport(warriorReports[count]);
    };

    const multipleTo = async (next, cancel) => {
      await next({ x: newDistanceRight, onRest });
      await next({ y: newDistanceDown, onRest });
      await next({ x: newDistanceLeft, onRest });
      await next({ y: newDistanceUp, onRest });
    };

    api.start({
      to: multipleTo,
      onResume: () => console.log('move spring has paused'),
      onResume: () => console.log('move spring has resumed'),
      config: config.gentle,
      loop: true,
    });
  };
`}
