<Headline text="Scripting Animation with react-spring" />

<Paragraph>
I've selected <Link url="https://www.react-spring.dev/">react-spring</Link> as the animation library for native html tags because I like how it is Physics based. I really enjoyed exploring the Box2D physics engine; it did such an amazing job of collision detection; but it's just not practical for building interface animations.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
I actually believe <Link url="https://greensock.com/gsap/">GSAP</Link> as has an easier API for beginners but there is something more compelling about react-spring.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
What if I could combine the ease of GSAP's API with the physics of react-spring?
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>I'll look at the various pieces that make up a complex animation breaking them down into individual commands like moveUp or moveDown so that we can eventually chain the commands together.</Paragraph>

<SubHeadline text="Simple Animation with useSpringRef and a command" />

<Paragraph>The <Link url="https://www.react-spring.dev/docs/concepts/imperative-api">Imperative API</Link> will control the animation without re-rendering the component. useSpringRef provides a hook and the ability to add multiple controllers to a single ref.
</Paragraph>

<SubHeadline text="SpringValue" />

<Paragraph>By learning about <Link url="https://www.react-spring.dev/docs/advanced/spring-value">SpringValue</Link>, we can better understand how to manipulate the animation over time.</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>Speaking of time, how can we controll how long or how short the animation is?</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>Since React-spring is physics-based, the time is controlled via the physical properties set in the <Link url="https://react-spring.dev/docs/advanced/config">spring configs.</Link></Paragraph>

<AnimateActorUseSpringRef />

<Paragraph>In this example, there doesn't seem to be much need for useSpringRef but I'm hoping that by using it here, it will eventually make it easier to chain commands together.</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>Within the props, each property is a SpringValue so it get the value of each one we need to use get()</Paragraph>

<pre>
<code className="language-javascript">
{`
const springRef = useSpringRef();
  const [isDisabled, setDisabled] = useState(false);

  const [props, api] = useSpring(
    () => ({
      ref: springRef,
      from: { x: 0, y: 0, z: 0 },
    }),
    []
  );

  const moveRight = distance => {
    const { x, y, z } = props;
    const curX = x.get();
    const newDistanceRight = curX + distance;
    const to = { x: newDistanceRight };

    api.start({
      to,
      onStart: () => console.log('the spring has started'),
      onChange: () => console.log('the spring has frame changed'),
      onRest: () => console.log('the spring has reached rest'),
      onPause: () => console.log('the spring has paused'),
      onResume: () => console.log('the spring has resumed'),
    });
  };

  const move = direction => {
    moveRight(100);
  };

  const handleClick = () => {
    if (!isDisabled) {
      const { x, y, z } = props;
      // limit the space that the actor can move
      if (x.get() <= 100) {
        move();
      }
    }
    setDisabled(true);
  };
`}

<SubHeadline text="Events" />

<Paragraph>By watching the <Link url="https://www.react-spring.dev/docs/advanced/events">events</Link>, we could build more complex animations. For instance, once the has animation has come to a rest, we move to another location.</Paragraph>

<SubHeadline text="useChain" />

<Paragraph>But there is an easier way to accomplish this orchestration. We can review the docs for <Link url="https://react-spring.dev/docs/components/use-chain">chain</Link> and <Link url="https://react-spring.dev/docs/advanced/async-animations">async animations</Link> to script the commands.</Paragraph>

<AnimateActorUseChain />

<Paragraph>Alright, that's cool but how do we break out of animation around responsd to an event? Again we turn to <Link url="https://react-spring.dev/docs/advanced/async-animations">async animations</Link> guide and this time use the supplied cancel function.</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>Let's build an animation where our Warrior is patrolling the castle grounds.</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>While docs show that we can pass a cancel function, I don't see how I can access nor use it effectively. Instead, and possibly easier, let's simply use the pause and resume api functions to achieve the same results.</Paragraph>

<AnimateActorPatrol />

<Paragraph>As a refactor idea, I would like to useReducer instead of useState. I wonder if a reducer would allow me to use its state instead of relying on a simply let for the counter.</Paragraph>

<pre>
<code className="language-javascript">
{`
 const springRef = useSpringRef();
  const [isDisabled, setDisabled] = useState(false);
  const [wispSpeach, setWispSpeechText] = useState('Halt!');
  //const [count, setCount] = useState(0); I used a simple let counter instead of useState

  const warriorReports = [
    'All clear',
    "What's for supper?",
    'I see nothing',
    'I see something...nah it was nothing',
    'Or did I?!',
  ];
  const [warriorReport, setWarriorReport] = useState('');

  const [props, api] = useSpring(
    () => ({
      ref: springRef,
      from: { x: 0, y: 0, z: 0 },
    }),
    []
  );

  const onRest = () => {
    console.log('onRest ', count);
    count = count < 4 ? count + 1 : 0;
    setWarriorReport(warriorReports[count]);
  };

  const move = distance => {
    const { x, y, z } = props;
    const curX = x.get();
    const curY = y.get();
    const newDistanceRight = curX + distance;
    const newDistanceDown = curY + distance;
    const newDistanceLeft = newDistanceRight - distance;
    const newDistanceUp = newDistanceDown - distance;

    const multipleTo = async (next, cancel) => {
      await next({ x: newDistanceRight, onRest });
      await next({ y: newDistanceDown, onRest });
      await next({ x: newDistanceLeft, onRest });
      await next({ y: newDistanceUp, onRest });
    };

    api.start({
      to: multipleTo,
      onResume: () => console.log('move spring has paused'),
      onResume: () => console.log('move spring has resumed'),
      config: config.gentle,
      loop: true,
    });
  };

  const handleClick = () => {
    // how can I access that cancel function?!
    // ok instead of using the cancel function
    // I can just use the pause and resume functions
    if (wispSpeach === 'Halt!') {
      api.pause();
      setWispSpeechText('Carry on!');
    } else {
      api.resume();
      setWispSpeechText('Halt!');
