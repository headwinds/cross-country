# Frozen Lake

<Subtitle>exploring tile based games with a recommendation engine</Subtitle>

<FrozenLake config={{text: "frozen lake", hasBackground: false}} isStandalone={true} />

<Paragraph>
When I discovered <Link url="https://gym.openai.com/envs/FrozenLake-v0/">Frozen Lake</Link>, a <Link url="https://gym.openai.com/envs/#toy_text">toy text environment</Link> by the open ai team, I knew that I had to try to re-create it as tile-based <Link url='https://twitter.com/LootBndt/status/1406551232861413376'>diorama.</Link> I wanted to turn it into a remote service so that UI could talk to it and get updated on each turn.  
</Paragraph>
<Paragraph>
I used the provided Python source from their Github repo to build the service using Flask. I created a project folder and setup a virtual environment for the Python app.
</Paragraph>
<Paragraph>
As mentioned in the <Link url="https://github.com/openai/gym#examples">gym examples</Link>, we need to create the interface for agent. In this case, we'll use React and D3.
</Paragraph>
<Paragraph>
In order for the agent to move through our environment, we need to implement:
</Paragraph>
<List>
  <ListItem>
    <Paragraph><Bold>reset()</Bold> Reset the environment's state.</Paragraph>
  </ListItem>
  <ListItem>
    <Paragraph><Bold>step(ACTION)</Bold> Step the environment by one timestep by passing an ACTION which is constant either LEFT, RIGHT, UP, or DOWN. Returns observation, reward, done, info. 
    </Paragraph>
  </ListItem>
  <ListItem>
    <Paragraph>
    <Bold>render()</Bold> Render one frame of the environment.
    </Paragraph>
  </ListItem>
</List>
<Paragraph>
  Along with learning for free, open source is awesome because it means we can change whatever we like. Instead of a tile named F for frozen, I'd like to rename it I for ice and introduce a new tile S for Snow. The ice tiles will have an slippery effect applied while the snow tiles will not. 
</Paragraph>
<Paragraph>We can still see the effect of a slippery tile when we print the result of a step.
</Paragraph>
<Paragraph>
Snow Tile
<pre>
<code className="language-javascript">
  {`
    (1, 0.0, False, {'prob': 1.0})
  `}
</code>
</pre>
</Paragraph>
<Paragraph>
Ice Tile
<pre>
<code className="language-javascript">
  {`
    (1, 0.0, False, {'prob': 0.33333333})
  `}
</code>
</pre>
</Paragraph>
<Paragraph>With a snow tile, the agent has 100% chance of advancing to the next tile that it selected, however, with the ice tile, there is 33% change of slipping off and landing on undesired tile. 
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
I'd like to share a link with my daughter for her access on her iPad. The link would launch an editor and lead her through the process of selecting and laying out buildings in grid. Once the layout is complete, the layout could be exported.  
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
While playing Roblox with my daughters, I noticed that they spend a lot of time working with clunky 2D UI to select customes and update the look of their characters. This type of play could also be handled completely within a web editor.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
Utlimately, it would be amazing to be able to leverage the Roblox API; import this layout; and have it build the world in 3D!
If not Roblox, could it imported another platform like the Sims?! 
</Paragraph>

<SubHeadline>Questions</SubHeadline>

<Paragraph>
While we are building the world, how can a machine best observe each step?  
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
Is there an open standard to export data to be used in other world building games? 
</Paragraph>

<SubHeadline>Session Collection</SubHeadline>

<Paragraph>
As we build the environment, each step is collected so that we can analyze the input and play back each step so the agent can learn from them.
</Paragraph>
