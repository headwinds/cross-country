# Garden

<Paragraph>I first learned about the digital garden metaphor from a <Link url="https://twitter.com/jhooks/status/1258097024139849729">jhooks tweet</Link> who followed that up with a <Link url="https://joelhooks.com/digital-garden">longer post</Link> explaining his thinking.

<Paragraph>
 Other creative developers like <Link url="https://joshbuchea.com/whats-a-digital-garden/">Josh Buchea</Link> and <Link url="https://garden.bradwoods.io/about">Brad Wooods</Link> also devoted posts to exploring this practice.

<Paragraph>
I like the use of emoji or icons to mark the state of work in progress:
</Paragraph>

<List>
  <ListItem>Seed - New content planted less than a year ago</ListItem>
  <ListItem>Sprout - Content planted over a year ago & regularly tended</ListItem>
  <ListItem>Mature - Content planted over 2 years ago & regularly tended</ListItem>
  <ListItem>Decaying - Content not tended in over a year</ListItem>
</List>

<Paragraph>
I would add consider adding pruning icon as a decay modifier. I will never finish all these projects, and pruning them down to a more manageable size is good thing for focus. But is the goal to finish or simply have fun learning?! By having a varied set of projects, I never lack for something to work on, and it's more fun than work if I only spend time on it until I lose interest or feel tired. 
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
What then is the difference creative coding and working? Most people get paid to finish projects for other people. I have had many moment though when I've enjoyed the work so much so that I would have done it for free but of course kept that to myself. A day job does pay to pursue these passion projects.
