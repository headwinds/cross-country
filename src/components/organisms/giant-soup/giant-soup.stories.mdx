<Paragraph>
We will use the Giant Soup API to test creating and updating a book by loading and saving the first page for the first chapter.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
The API is written in Java. Why Java?! After nearly 20 years of ignoring it I decided to learn it. Frankly, I was a bit intimidated by it; certainly due 
to years of overhearing other devs complain about it and possibly the belief that I thought it was a dying language. I had spent the last few years focussing
on Python. But guess what? Java is not dead. I had a momemnt where I realized that twently years of Java development meant a lot of systems that would need maintenance.
There is a financial opportunity to use Java to write and improve existing software system knowing that many companies are basically stuck on the platform. 
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
When you see a large enterprise that has hundreds of cronjobs written in Java and the average time to update any file within the enterprise takes at least a week of review
time, it become obvious that switching to some new language like Rust or Go is nearly impossible. While I'm eager to write micro-services, in many cases it simply
makes better business sense to maintain and shore up existing systems.

Java is beautiful. Java is disgusting.

<Paragraph>
When harvesting D3 scripts from <Link url="https://bl.ocks.org/">Bl.ocks</Link> or <Link url="https://observablehq.com/">Observerable</Link>, you may discover that they do a lot in each function. Any time you see long functions, this is an opportunity to refactor and make it easier to maintain.
These long functions are basically pipelines that assemble the final visualization. 
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
Each step in the pipeline can (and should be) its own function. So when you copy and paste in a long function, take this opportunity to break it up and learn from each step! 
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
As port each function, you begin to explore the codebase and learn more about the complexities of color through <Link url="https://github.com/d3/d3-scale-chromatic">d3-scale-chromatic</Link> and how color can potentialy confuse your audience.
