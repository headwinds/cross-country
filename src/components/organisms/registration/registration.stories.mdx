First, I visited xstate-catalogue and reviewed the [basic form input example](https://xstate-catalogue.com/machines/form-input) and I also googled for xstate form examples finding exellent tutorials: [Maher Alkendi](https://dev.to/ma7eer/basic-form-flow-using-xstate-and-react-4fgg), [thewidlarzgroup](https://thewidlarzgroup.com/multistep-form-xstate-formik/), and
[css-tricks](https://css-tricks.com/using-react-and-xstate-to-build-a-sign-in-form/).

Next, I tried to take their best practices and stub out the main states I would need for registration.
