What do I want to achieve with my own home page?

- I'm a professional web developer with an eye for desgin so typicall focus on frontend UI
- I want to work with analytics and collaborate with data scientists
- work within a service industry that cares about the environment
- I enjoy prototyping and gamification
- flexible: if I'm not looking for work, my site could express more personality as ulimately it's nice to connect with people and feel that my experiments interest others and vice versa - currently my site is more of window than a bridge

It's the early days of the web, we had web rings. I want to build something similar but with graph theory to build more of a networked fleet than a ring.
