What can we do with a tile?

In games or sci-fi films, it is common to see the corners of tile hilight and pulse when the tile is activated.

I wanted a similar effect, and first I searched the web for inspiration finding <Link customClass="story-link" url="https://codepen.io/NyX/pen/JYOzWW">this take</Link> which is perfect for this story. 

<Canvas>
  <Story name="tile">
    <Column>
      <Tile />
    </Column>
  </Story>
