# Tree

<Subtitle>for rendering rendering parent child relationships</Subtitle>

<Paragraph>
  The tree component is used to render parent child relationships. It is most commonly used in a menu component.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
  I first approached this problem on paper. I drew 4 indented boxes representing a tree; each indent pushing further
  out. Once I reached the last box, I could see the probem. How do I close off all the boxes to return the first box?
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
  My idea was to record the path of the tree as it was traversed in an array. This would allow me to close off the boxes
  as I went back up the tree. As I moved from div to ul to ol to li, I could push each element tag into the array. Then,
  I could follow the array from first to last to close off the boxes.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
  But what If I only need to back 2 levels? This would still work. I could keep an index on the array and then read the
  array at that index to return.
