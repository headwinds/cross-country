<Paragraph>
Since I'm dealing with serverless, I need be aware of how Vercel can help with <Link url="https://github.com/vercel/next.js/discussions/12134">rate limiting</Link> and protect the API against attacks. I am using the <Link url="https://pypi.org/project/Flask-Limiter/">flask_limiter</Link> library but am uncertain whether or not it will work for serverless?!
