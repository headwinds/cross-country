# Too Many Connections

<Subtitle>We cannot connect to the database</Subtitle>

When a user makes a request to the server which needs to query a database, ideally they should receive data back in less than a second (< 400 ms).

What happens when we are using the serverless host, [Vercel](https://vercel.com), and we have multiple users attempting to connect to the same database? With a serverless function, we will open connection to the database when the function begins and close the connection the connection after it completes. 

Our database has a limited amount of connections. If our plan on [ElephantSQL](https://www.elephantsql.com/plans.html) has only 10 concurrent connections and they are all taken, what happens to the next user who attempts to request data? We don't want them to receive a "too many connections" error! 

Instead, we can provide feedback that the user may need to wait longer while the server continually attempts to connect finally returning the requested data.

It took me too long to find a decent article how to display a code snippet in Storybook so a special thanks to Jason Ewins and his write up,  
 [get prismjs working in react](https://medium.com/get-it-working/get-prismjs-working-in-react-a6d989e59290). I didn't want a code panel but like I have above where I can talk about and include the code in the same document.
