# Cronjob

<Subtitle>a dashboard which monitors the status of a serverless cronjob </Subtitle>

<Paragraph>
When using serverless, how can we setup a cronjob and that can be monitored so that are confident that the automation is working each week?

Vercel does offer <Link url="https://vercel.com/docs/solutions/cron-jobs">some suggestions.</Link>. From this list, I tried a few of them including EasyCron, Quirrel and Github Actions. GA was the easiet and cheapest of the bunch to implement so would recommend it as your first attempt.

<SubHeadline>Local Schedule</SubHeadline>
<Paragraph>
Instead of hosting the cronjob, I thought I might be able to get away with running it from my local machine. While I'm at my desktop, my computer is on most of the days. But I learned that as soon as I step away from machine, my mac will sleep and thus the process will stop.

<Paragraph>
I currently experimenting with using the <Link url="https://www.howtogeek.com/245683/how-to-prevent-your-mac-from-sleeping-with-no-additional-software/">caffeinate command</Link> which will keep my computer awake so that the process will run. Since I only need to process to run on certain, I can then disable it on days with no jobs so that the computer can get some shut eye.

At work, I have the opportunity to learn large enterprise systems within Google Cloud so have taken the opportunity to build a reporting tool.

To perform a cronjob, we can use Cloud Scheduler to set a datetime for a Cloud Function to some work like collecting lighthouse audits every monday and storing them in BigQuery. I did exactly this by following an excellent, detailed <Link url="https://www.simoahava.com/google-cloud/lighthouse-bigquery-google-cloud-platform/">article</Link>.

After assembling this solution, I also collaborated with a colleague to take the various parts and use <Link url='https://cloud.google.com/docs/terraform'>Terraform</Link> to help "whitelabel" the solution so that another company within the organization could repeat it.

<SubHeadline>Down the Rabbit Hole</SubHeadline>
<Paragraph>
Have you ever asked yourself what else is there? How deep is the stack? You'll reach a place after a few years of programming and start to want to explore the other side. For instance, if you focussed on the frontend client-side coding, you may begin to work with server-side languages and databases or vice versa for backend devs. 
Once you're reasonably full-stack and have assembled some front to back solution. You might want more.

Enter the rabbit hole of machine learning. ML, with its various sub fields: computer vision, NLP, re-inforcement learning, will easily open the door to another 5+ years of study, and another opportunity to specialize. Personally, I've decided to dive deeply into recommendation and re-inforcment learning. 
fascination where we can guide our agents to perform tasks and drastically reduce human performing repetitive tasks.

<Paragraph>
I see great cross-over potential to approach ML through game mechanics and apply them to real world applications. The future of Machine Teaching is also fascination where we can guide our agents to perform tasks and drastically reduce human performing repetitive tasks.
