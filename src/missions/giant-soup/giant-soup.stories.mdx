We will use the Giant Soup API to test creating and updating a book by loading and saving the first page for the first chapter.

The API is written in Java. Why Java?! After nearly 20 years of ignoring it I decided to learn it. Frankly, I was a bit intimidated by it; certainly due 
to years of overhearing other devs complain about it and possibly the belief that I thought it was a dying language. I had spent the last few years focussing
on Python. But guess what? Java is not dead. I had a momemnt where I realized that twently years of Java development meant a lot of systems that would need maintenance.
There is a financial opportunity to use Java to write and improve existing software system knowing that many companies are basically stuck on the platform. 

When you see a large enterprise that has hundreds of cronjobs written in Java and the average time to update any file within the enterprise takes at least a week of review
time, it become obvious that switching to some new language like Rust or Go is nearly impossible. While I'm eager to write micro-services, in many cases it simply
makes better business sense to maintain and shore up existing systems. 

Java is beautiful. Java is disgusting.
