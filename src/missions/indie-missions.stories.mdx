# Too Many Connections

<Subtitle>so you want to be an indie hero?</Subtitle>

When we build worlds, we are often doing so as solo dev or within a small team. For the sake of simplicity, I'm going to call everything we build a game whether it be an animation experiment, music player, or simulation. 

The game is the journey, and while on this adventure, we are furthering our skills, exploring the medium, and pushing ourselves out of our general comfort zone.
