# XState

<Subtitle>XState for the rest of us...</Subtitle>

<Paragraph>
  XState promotes building small state machines to assemble large, complex applications. By using XState as our finite
  state machine, we are able to introduce new states with less worry about the consequences on previous states. That's
  the longterm payoff. The short term pain is learning a new system of dispatching events and storing data. There is a
  learning curve for developing the machine pattern which is steeper than useState. The spotlight light example is an
  excellent introduction to XState.

  After that, I wanted to learn how to use many machines in orchestration similar to principles of components
  development and functional programming. Small machines are easier to understand on their own than large machines. With
  planning, you can build small machines that work together to a produce a complicated system.

  On the surface, XState feels like rigid, complicated system, and I want to see how it might fit into my rapid
  prototyping process so that I can still experiment with various states until I discover the right mix. How can XState
  help me plan and design the experience? The short answer is that it forces one to think in steps or turns. The games I
  want to make are turn-based where the player steps through a world.

  What is a good quest but a series of interesting steps? In many games, quests are more like chores. A chore can be
  fascinating if something you may never a get a chance to do. For instnace, I like farming simulators as I will
  probably never live on a farm. I know that the reality of farm is both grueling and rewarding; involving long days and
  back-breaking labour. Within a game however there is no heavy work but only potentially the boredom of repeatious
  actions which can be seen as bad game design.

  It can be entertaing to raise virtual chickens but we don't want to repeat that experience if the gamer isn't having
  fun anymore. We can provide options to progress to other chores with new appeal! Who is going to have a blast mucking
  out the dragon den before they return from their hunt? You are! As game designers, we are going to both design and
  play through encounters like this, and we should make them fun to code and antipicate some joy that are players will
  feel to inspire and propel us forward to finish it!
