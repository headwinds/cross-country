<Paragraph>
When harvesting D3 scripts from <Link url="https://bl.ocks.org/">Bl.ocks</Link> or <Link url="https://observablehq.com/">Observerable</Link>, you may discover that they do a lot in each function. Any time you see long functions, this is an opportunity to refactor and make it easier to maintain.
These long functions are basically pipelines that assemble the final visualization. 
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
Each step in the pipeline can (and should be) its own function. So when you copy and paste in a long function, take this opportunity to break it up and learn from each step! 
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
