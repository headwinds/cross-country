# Frozen Lake

<Subtitle>a mico game about re-inforcement learning</Subtitle>

<Paragraph>
When I discovered <Link url="https://gym.openai.com/envs/FrozenLake-v0/">Frozen Lake</Link>, a <Link url="https://gym.openai.com/envs/#toy_text">toy text environment</Link> by the open ai team, I knew that I had to try to re-create it as tile-based <Link url='https://twitter.com/LootBndt/status/1406551232861413376'>diorama.</Link> I wanted to turn it into a remote service so that UI could talk to it and get updated on each turn.  
</Paragraph>
<Paragraph>
I used the provided Python source from their Github repo to build the service using Flask. I created a project folder and setup a virtual environment for the Python app.
</Paragraph>
<Paragraph>
As mentioned in the <Link url="https://github.com/openai/gym#examples">gym examples</Link>, we need to create the interface for agent. In this case, we'll use React and D3.
</Paragraph>
<Paragraph>
In order for the agent to move through our environment, we need to implement:
</Paragraph>
<List>
  <ListItem>
    <Paragraph><Bold>reset()</Bold> Reset the environment's state.</Paragraph>
  </ListItem>
  <ListItem>
    <Paragraph><Bold>step(ACTION)</Bold> Step the environment by one timestep by passing an ACTION which is constant either LEFT, RIGHT, UP, or DOWN. Returns observation, reward, done, info. 
    </Paragraph>
  </ListItem>
  <ListItem>
    <Paragraph>
    <Bold>render()</Bold> Render one frame of the environment.
    </Paragraph>
  </ListItem>
</List>
<Paragraph>
  Along with learning for free, open source is awesome because it means we can change whatever we like. Instead of a tile named F for frozen, I'd like to rename it I for ice and introduce a new tile S for Snow. The ice tiles will have an slippery effect applied while the snow tiles will not. 
</Paragraph>
<Paragraph>We can still see the effect of a slippery tile when we print the result of a step.
</Paragraph>
<Paragraph>
Snow Tile
<pre>
<code className="language-javascript">
  {`
    (1, 0.0, False, {'prob': 1.0})
  `}
</code>
</pre>
</Paragraph>
<Paragraph>
Ice Tile
<pre>
<code className="language-javascript">
  {`
    (1, 0.0, False, {'prob': 0.33333333})
  `}
</code>
</pre>
</Paragraph>
<Paragraph>With a snow tile, the agent has 100% chance of advancing to the next tile that it selected, however, with the ice tile, there is 33% change of slipping off and landing on undesired tile. 
</Paragraph>
