import { Meta, Canvas, Story, Subtitle } from "@storybook/blocks";
import * as TemplateStories from "./template.stories";

1. Copy and paste these 2 files into the folder of the component
2. rename the title in the component.stories.tsx and start storybook
3. make sure the stubbed in story appears in the sidebar
4. Rename both templates files to component.mdx and component.stories.tsx file to match the component you are creating a story for.
5. Rename the path in the component.stories.tsx file to match the component
6. Find & Replace template variables to your component variable name
7. note: you may need to restart storybook after renaming the files
8. delete these points ;-D

I really wish it was easier to do this but I seem to run into so many configuration issues with CSF files!

<Meta of={TemplateStories} />

# Template

This is a template for creating a new story.

```jsx
<Template message="hello there " />
```

### Story
