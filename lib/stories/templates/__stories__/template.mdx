import { Meta, Canvas, Story, Subtitle } from "@storybook/blocks";
import * as TemplateStories from "./template.stories";

1. Copy and paste these 2 files into the folder of the component
2. Rename both templates files to component.mdx and component.stories.tsx file to match the component you are creating a story for.
3. Rename the path in the component.stories.tsx file to match the component
4. Find & Replace template variables to your component variable name
5. note: you may need to restart storybook after renaming the files
6. delete these points ;-D

<Meta of={TemplateStories} />
