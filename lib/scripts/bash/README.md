### Custom Commit

Motivation: I tend to attempt to solve problem by jumping into code and raising a PR which can be preceived as a threat instead of an exploration.

Reflection: Code that offends can also be used to protect. I need more guard rails before I push; in fact before I commit!

Questons to ask myself before committing?

- will anyone deem this solution a hack? Does it smell like a hack?!
- Did you ask anyone to take a moment and act as a sounding board to talk through problem
- Did you book a meeting to discuss it?
- again, is this code a threat to anyone; think carefully as much as you think it fire, what are some ways it could burn you?!!!
- is it less than 200 lines?
