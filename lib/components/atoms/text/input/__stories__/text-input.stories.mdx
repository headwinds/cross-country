# Text Input

There text input comes in two flavors: the regular text input and the state machine text input.

## Text Input

This is the first text input that I developed and may deprecate since the state machine text input is more flexible and has more features.

## State Machine Text Input

In the state machine story, I will show it's ability debounce input so that the API endpoint isn't overwhelmed. 

The user will input text for a route that will be used to fetch data from an API demonstrating how to 
[invoke](https://stately.ai/docs/invoke) an actor using XState.

## Medium 

In creating a blog, it's always a good idea to review the competition. Medium is a popular platform for writers and I wanted to see how their text input works. Or doesn't work! When editing a post, their text input is actually a content editable div. 

I found this both surprising and interesting so after [asking perplexity](https://www.perplexity.ai/search/blog-13SAPvEGSASP1WK.9dveMQ#0) on the value of `contenteditable`, I have attempted to recreate it in the state machine.


<Canvas>
  <Story name="standard">
    <TextInputStory />
  </Story>
  <Story name="standard with default value">
    <TextInputDefaultValueStory />
  </Story>
  <Story name="state machine input">
    <StateMachineTextInputStory />
  </Story>
    <Story name="state machine contenteditable">
    <StateMachineContentEditableStory />
  </Story>
</Canvas>
