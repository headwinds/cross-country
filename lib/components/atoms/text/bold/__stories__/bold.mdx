# Bold

In most cases, we can use a simple bold class instead of a component but since bold acts like a span and can take any style, there is an opportunity to reinvest bold with animation and flare.

```jsx
.storyBold {
  font-weight: 500;
  display: inline-block; /* Ensures the transform works as expected */
  animation: bounceAndGrow 2s ease-in-out 1s;
}

@keyframes bounceAndGrow {
  0%,
  100% {
    transform: scale(1);
    color: black;
  }
  50% {
    transform: scale(2) translateX(10px);
    color: red;
    font-weight: 900;
  }
}
