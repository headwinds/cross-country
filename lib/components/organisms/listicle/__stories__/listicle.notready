# Listicle

A listicle is an easy way to getting into the habit of sharing links to articles, videos, or other media, grouped into a category. A listicle is a type of blog post, and this is a tool to help create and edit them quickly.

Also, I don't want to email myself links to review anymore! I want to be build a system where I can send links to be processed into a listcle and eventually deleted after I've reviewed them. I don't want to horde links in my email or browser anymore, and make them much more [empheral](https://tribe.digital/insights/what-is-ephemeral-content).

## Presentation

A listicle is a list of links to articles, videos, or other media, grouped into a category.

THe category is currently required and easy to add but am considering making it optional if there is enough feedback to do so.

The listicle could be presented as a list of grouped links, or as a table. It could be possibly setup as grid of cards if image previews are available.

## Facebook vs The Canadian Media

Due to current the [Meta legal battles in Canada](https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/online-news-act-meta-facebook-1.6885634) between social sites and the news, we can't directly share links on Facebook and promote Canadian content.

It's a little disturbing that this ban has had [no impact on Canadian Facebook activity](https://www.reuters.com/technology/metas-canada-news-ban-fails-dent-facebook-usage-2023-08-29/).

## Challenge

I learned that FB won't allow me directly post a link to a Canadian website but am I able to post a link to my website which is freely hosted on Vercel and I imagine it works since it has an American IP and is not recognized as Canadian news but of course I'm Canadian based in Toronto and am I both promoting and creating Canadian news!

Since I can post a link to my website, I want to be to allow myslef and others the ability to easily share links to Canadian media without being blocked. I can take inspiration from [link tree](https://linktr.ee/s/pricing/) which you can see is for profit business, and a quite (ridiculously so?!) [profitable](https://research.contrary.com/reports/linktree) company which encourages the [side hustle](https://linktr.ee/blog/side-hustle-business-success-money-tips/).

If you visit [link tree](https://linktr.ee/) though, their flow is geared towards getting you to signup whereas I want a flow to build a listcle which will produce a link that you can post on your social site like Facebook or Twitter.

There is media battle happening in Canada between social sites like Google & Facebook and Canadian news agencies.

Share Links

I want to address this legal issue head on and speak to a Canadian compared to the global, 12M users of Linktree. I currently have a user base of 1.

## Affliate Links

If you promote a promote a product or service, you can use an affliate link to earn a commission. Many companies offer affliate programs and you can find them on [Affliate Marketing](https://www.affiliatemarketing.com/).

### Amazon Affliate Program

I tried Amazon's [affliate program](https://affiliate-program.amazon.com/) and, after receiving an email nag, I learned that I need to sell 3 items within 180 days to remain in the program!

### Listicle ID

Anyone who creates a listicle will be given a unique ID which they can use to access their listicle, and each url can be tagged with this ID to track the number of clicks and shares so that we can attribute the success of the listicle to the creator and potentially offer them a share of the revenue.

Since the first listicle id may be anonymous, it can be associated with your known user account enabling you can claim any revenue generated by the listicle.

### Collections of People

When creating a listicle that is a collection of individual people, you can tag each link with the person's name and the listicle will be presented as a table with the person's name and the link to their profile.

I'd to explore how I could possibly connect links such that both owners of the links are aware of the connection and can thus message each other and potentially collaborate.

It should be obvious to connect a collection of talent to a collection of jobs and/or people hiring!

### Listicles without the numbers

Personally, I don't like the numbers in listicles and would rather list items in a collection without them so I have provided the option to hide the numbers.

### Remove extraneous url information

When pasting a link, you may or may not wish to keep everything in the url. For example, the following url is quite long and contains a lot of tracking information that you may not want to share. Basically, anything after the `?` is tracking information and can be safely removed and you can still visit the site but you may lose the ability to track the link.
