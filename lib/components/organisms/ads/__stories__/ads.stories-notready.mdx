[Google Ad Sense](https://stately.ai/docs/invoke)



So you want to monetize your website? 

You can use Google Ad Sense to do that but how long does it take to get approved and setup an ad on your site?

Let's find out! Copilot has generated these 3 steps which I'll take and confirm with you.

1. [Sign up for Google Ad Sense](https://www.google.com/adsense/start/)
2. [Create an ad unit](https://www.google.com/adsense/start/)
3. [Add the ad unit to your website](https://www.google.com/adsense/start/)


My first decision after clicking Get Started was to choose what ad type that I wanted to display on my website.

I'm going to start with a vertical ad unit. I named my ad unit "Vertical Ad" and left it as responsive. I clicked "Create" and then "Copy code" to get the code to add to my website.

Next, I had to choose between HTML and AMP. I chose HTML and then copied the code to my clipboard.
