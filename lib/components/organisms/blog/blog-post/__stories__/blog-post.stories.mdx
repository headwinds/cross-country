# Blog Post

As a first time user with no posts, I want to authenticate once, and set a cookie,

Then it will remember me for a while so that I don't have to authenticate every time I want to write a post.

My post should be in draft status until I'm ready to publish it.

When I return, my most recent draft should be loaded.

### Gold Leaf Post

When reviewing the golf leaf cards, at any time, if inspiration strikes, I should be able to make a new post. The `BlogPost` component can be the size of a card, and can be placed anywhere on the page.
