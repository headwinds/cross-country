# Blog Post

At anytime (and from anywhere) I should be able to write a new post. 

The `BlogPost` component can be the size of a card. The card design make its mobile-first, and can be placed anywhere on the page.

# Flow

As a first time, a user will have no posts so they should be encouraged to write a new post.

I want to authenticate once, and set a cookie or use local storage so that I don't have to authenticate every time I want to write a post.

My post should be in draft status until I'm ready to publish it. I want to auto save my draft every 5 minutes (or maybe every time I make a change - every word?!). Or every 30 seconds if there is a change?! Not sure yet but the goal is not lose work if I forget to save.

When I return, my most recent draft should be loaded.

### Cards

At any time, if inspiration strikes, a user should be able to make a new post. 

The `BlogPost` component can be the size of a card, and can be placed anywhere on the page.

<Canvas>
  <Story name="blog post">
    <BlogPostStory />
  </Story>
</Canvas>
