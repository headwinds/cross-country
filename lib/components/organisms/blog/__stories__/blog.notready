# Blog

A blog is the ultimate form of content marketing and self publishing.

Itâ€™s a platform for sharing your ideas, connecting with your audience, and establishing yourself as an authority in your niche; or at least that you've been done that path and can offer guidance.

### Auth

It is a bit tempting to allow the ability to blog anonymously, but for this version, we will require a user to be authenticated to post a blog.
