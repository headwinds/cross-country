### Area of Effect (AOE)

I think I first of heard of AOE in the context of World of Warcraft. WOW had a lot of acroynms to learn and use in chat to discuss the game and strategies with other players; and not feel like a n00b.

Unlike a single arrow that targets a single player, an AOE is an attack that affects all players within a certain radius.

Besides effects, we are also interested in the area around the player to determine movement and their proximity to potential targets and threats in the game.

Along with AOE, agro was another term I learned from WOW. Agro is the attention of a mob or monster.

If you have agro, you are the target of the mob. If you are a healer, you want to avoid agro. If you are a tank, you want to have agro so that the mob is focused on you and not the healer or other players.
