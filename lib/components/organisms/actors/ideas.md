# Actors

## Actor Generator 

After building the Hunter, I manually created the Wizard, Cleric & Warrior by copying the Hunter folder and renaming the files.

I should be able to take the generate-component script to automate this process or I wonder if I can turn it a UI with database records? 

What fields would an actor table have? It would be fun to develop an actor creator/editor! You could either start with a blank actor or fork a template. How could templates be combined like in D&D to create multi-class characters?

## Let's make cozy games!

Why stop at fantasy tropes?! With a community of [cozy game](https://www.wired.com/gallery/best-cozy-games/) ethusiants who also want to build their own game, we could share tools to make more games together and explore all kinds of genres! 

I know I'm not alone in finding it both fun and challenging to create a small game experience. To begin, I need to need to create a template that could be extended. The art and story should be easy to replace. Like going from [warcraft to starcraft](https://starcraft.fandom.com/wiki/Warcraft) and [vice versa](https://80.lv/articles/a-fan-is-making-a-warcraft-iii-remake-in-the-starcraft-ii-engine/), it should be a straightforward leap to look at the engine and think this could be set in any time, in any world! With no limits on theme but within limits of a tile-based experience and engine.
