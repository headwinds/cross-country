To monitor the correct working of the three APUs and the hydraulic systems, the APU/HYD screen is used. It shows quantities of hydrazine fuel, coolant water and hydraulic fluid as well as hydrazine tank pressure, APU oil temperature and hydraulic pressure.

Any off-nominal values change the bars to red.

Except for the hydraulic fluid quantity (leaking of fluid is not yet simulated) all values shown are meaningful in FG.
