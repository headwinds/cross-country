For one, the graphics are now in HD, which makes the aerial islands and dungeons look more vibrant and detailed. You can play it with motion controls or with a modified button and stick layout. The non-motion controls take a bit to get used to, but overall they are pretty good.</p><p>The tutorial section has also been cleaned up, letting you get to the meat of the game without a boring slog through dozens of menus and slow-paced introductory missions. Autosaving, skippable cutscenes, and reworked camera controls round out the most important updates.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/today-only-deal-the-legend-of-zelda-skyward-sword-hd-for-lowest-price-yet/1100-6505723/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>',
