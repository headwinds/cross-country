# One day

We often see flipping text on website or mobile app. This is a simple example of flipping text animation.

Let's combine some static and dynamic text to create a flipping text animation.

Let's turn one day into day one! 



<Canvas>
  <Story name="one day">
    <OneDay animatedTextArr={["Let's turn", "one day", " into", "Day One!"]} textWidth={300} />
  </Story>
</Canvas>
