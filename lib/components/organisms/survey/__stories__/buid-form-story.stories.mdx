# Build a Survey or Quiz

Originally, I started to started to develop this form builder with [React Hook Form](https://react-hook-form.com/) but realized that react-hook-form was a better suited for a finalized form schema.

While building the form and deciding on the question types, xstate is excellent at updating the state of this exploration while we decide on what questions are appropriate. 

There are actually two state machines at play: the parent state machine manages the entire form and children state machines manage the options of the each multiple choice question. 

Perhaps, I can find a cute way to use `register` and `onChange`...
