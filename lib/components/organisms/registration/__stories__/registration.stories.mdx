# Registration

The minimal form registration is basically an email address but I'll also capture the username and password at this point, everything else like first and last name will be collected later as part of the onboarding process and profile setup.

<Canvas>
  <Story name="registration">
    <Registration
      config={{
        text: "Registration",
        hasBackground: false,
        onChange: () => {},
      }}
    />
  </Story>
  <Story name="password helper invalid">
    <PasswordStrengthHelper
      isPasswordFocussed={true}
      candidatePassword="hellowo"
    />
  </Story>
  <Story name="password helper valid">
    <PasswordStrengthHelper
      isPasswordFocussed={true}
      candidatePassword="Hello1world!"
    />
  </Story>
</Canvas>
