What can we do with a tile?

In games or sci-fi films, it is common to see the corners of tile hilight and pulse when the tile is activated.

I wanted a similar effect, and first I searched the web for inspiration finding <Link customClass="story-link" url="https://codepen.io/NyX/pen/JYOzWW">this take</Link> which is perfect for this story.

Color intrepolation is an interesting approach to transitioning a tile's colour from one to another.

We can use react-spring to animate the tile's color.

[impressive threejs color example](https://github.com/pmndrs/react-three-fiber/discussions/763#discussion-27296)

<Canvas>
  <Story name="tile">
    <Column>
      <TileStory type="interactive" model={{ id: 0, fill: 'lightblue' }} />
    </Column>
  </Story>
  <Story name="animate tile color">
    <AnimatedTileStory />
  </Story>
</Canvas>
