# Tile

What can we do with a tile? Or better what can't we do!

In games or sci-fi films, it is common to see the corners of tile hilight and pulse when the tile is activated.

I wanted a similar effect, and first I searched the web for inspiration finding <Link customClass="story-link" url="https://codepen.io/NyX/pen/JYOzWW">this take</Link> which is perfect for this story.

Color intrepolation is an interesting approach to transitioning a tile's colour from one to another.

We can use react-spring to animate the tile's color.

While this is certainly an [impressive threejs color example](https://github.com/pmndrs/react-three-fiber/discussions/763#discussion-27296), I have no enough problems in the 2D space so wil continue to focus on the flat. My hunch is that other creators share this passion for tile-based art like this [tweet by @bwalter_indie](https://twitter.com/bwalter_indie/status/1779169035218739625?s=43&t=JosrImXLm25J_T3QQadmMw) and likewise are looking for anything that could [reduce the friction](https://twitter.com/startuparchive_/status/1779477221788561734?s=43&t=JosrImXLm25J_T3QQadmMw).
