# Card

I first learned of the card metaphor strategy of design via [Material UI Cards](https://m2.material.io/components/cards) and thought is was compelling as it can help to organize information in a way that is easy to understand and navigate and follows the principles of a [mobile first design](https://www.uxpin.com/studio/blog/a-hands-on-guide-to-mobile-first-design/).
