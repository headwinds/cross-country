# Card

I first learned of the card metaphor strategy for web design via [Material UI Cards](https://m2.material.io/components/cards). 

It can help to organize information in a way that is easy to understand and navigate and follows the principles of a [mobile first design](https://www.uxpin.com/studio/blog/a-hands-on-guide-to-mobile-first-design/).

On most eCommerce stores, the card design is used to display products. The card design is also used in social media platforms to display posts.

A card usually features a large image or video, a title, a description, and a call to action like a Learn More or Buy button.

The card is a versatile design element that can be used in many different ways. It can be used to display a product, a blog post, a video, a photo, or any other type of content. It has fluid dimension is designed to be contained within a parent grid, or we can pass in a custom class or style.
