# Card

I first learned of the card metaphor strategy for web design via [Material UI Cards](https://m2.material.io/components/cards). 

It can help to organize information in a way that is easy to understand and navigate and follows the principles of a [mobile first design](https://www.uxpin.com/studio/blog/a-hands-on-guide-to-mobile-first-design/).

On most eCommerce stores, the card design is used to display products. The card design is also used in social media platforms to display posts or within a game to display a character or item.

A card usually features a large image or video, a title, a description, and a call to action like a Learn More or Buy button.

The card is a versatile design element that can be used in many different ways. It can be used to display a product, a blog post, a video, a photo, or any other type of content. It has fluid dimension is designed to be contained within a parent grid, or we can pass in a custom class or style.

### eCommerce Inspiration

Visit any product list page on a major brand site and study the card design. For instance, [Balenciaga hoodies](https://www.balenciaga.com/en-ca/men/ready-to-wear/sweatshirts-and-hoodies) have a card design within a grid.

### Amazon Affliate 

While browsing [golds](https://golds.vercel.app/), I spotted an interesting card design for a [Keychron K8 Wireless Mechanical Keyboard](https://www.polygon.com/deals/24115480/keychron-k8-wireless-mechanical-keyboard-deal-sale) and looked it up on [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Keychron-Bluetooth-Mechanical-Keyboard-Backlight/dp/B08LZLZPQJ) as well as youtube for a [review](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ie4dkqvNK6Q).

What type of questions to do I ask myself when considering a purchase? Beside myself, I'd like to know what would my friends think and would they also recommend it. Is it a popular item? What is the return policy? What is the warranty? What is the shipping time? What is the quality of the product? What is the
Cost? Any discounts?

Any products that are branded with nature imagery or are eco-friendly are of interest to me. For instance, I like the [cedar smoke candle](https://www.amazon.ca/dp/B08WCCQZBN?pd_rd_i=B08WCCQZBN&pd_rd_w=3sSdC&content-id=amzn1.sym.ce8c76eb-f5b4-45c3-9781-2b2c804518c0&pf_rd_p=ce8c76eb-f5b4-45c3-9781-2b2c804518c0&pf_rd_r=7F8DCGH28ZPG9SZXV2G4&pd_rd_wg=hWnVU&pd_rd_r=c88be83f-272e-45df-9384-bcb1f9144025&s=electronics&sp_csd=d2lkZ2V0TmFtZT1zcF9kZXRhaWxfdGhlbWF0aWM&th=1&linkCode=ll1&tag=headwinds0d-20&linkId=8c2e6b7649f85c04f79fce018e85a9b9&language=en_CA&ref_=as_li_ss_tl) and the [Nature's Garden Heart Healthy Trail Mix](https://amzn.to/4aJgB31).


Why does it feel a bit shady to get some super small percentage for recommending a product and becoming an [Amazon Affiliate](https://affiliate-program.amazon.com/)?!

There is a pyschological aspect to it, where I feel like I am selling out or that I am not being genuine. I think it is important to be transparent and honest about the products that I recommend and to only recommend products that I truly believe in. 

I also don't want to handle all the grunt work and logistics of managing an inventory or shipping products. I'd rather focus on creating content and designing the online store.
