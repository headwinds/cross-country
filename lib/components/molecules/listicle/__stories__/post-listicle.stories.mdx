## Facebook vs The Canadian Media 

Due to current the [Meta legal battles in Canada](https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/online-news-act-meta-facebook-1.6885634) between social sites and the news, we can't directly share links on Facebook and promote Canadian content.

It's a little disturbing that this ban has had [no impact on Canadian Facebook activity](https://www.reuters.com/technology/metas-canada-news-ban-fails-dent-facebook-usage-2023-08-29/).
