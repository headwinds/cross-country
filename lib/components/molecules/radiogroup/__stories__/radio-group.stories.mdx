# Radio Group

A radio group is a group of radio buttons. It is used to select one option exclusively.

We can use the RadioGroup with or without the [react-hook-form](https://www.react-hook-form.com/) library but it is encouraged to use it with the library.

I have included two stories so that you can see the difference between the two.

<Canvas>
  <Story name="radio group">
    <RadioGroupFormStory />
  </Story>
    <Story name="radio group with react-hook-form">
    <RadioGroupFormStory />
  </Story>
</Canvas>
