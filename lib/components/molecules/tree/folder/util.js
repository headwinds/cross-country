Write a function that takes a string input of a math word problem and then
returns the result of that problem.

Supported operations are: plus, minus, multiplied by, divided by

ex) Input: "What is 5 plus 3" Output: 8

- Talk through your thought process.
- Searching for help is allowed but not for the whole answer.
- Can ask the interviewers for help or clarification.
- This is not a pass fail challenge, weâ€™re more interested in the problem solving.

Step 1 - Basic operations

calculate("What is 5 plus 3")
calculate("What is 234 plus 72")
calculate("What is 7 minus 5")
calculate("What is -2 plus -7")
calculate("What is 3 multiplied by 5")
calculate("What is 10 divided by 2")

Step 2 - Multiple operations

calculate("What is 1 plus 3 plus 7")
calculate("What is 3 minus 7 plus 4")

Step 3 - Error handling

calculate("What is 52 cubed")
calculate("What is plus 1 2")
calculate("What is")
