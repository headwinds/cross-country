### Controls

Depening on the context and channel, the Gold Leaf View can be configured with different controls.

Through settings, we should be able to setup controls that they use the most.

Taking inspiration from the iPhone main app bar, we should limit the number of controls to 4, and use the same idea that each control is like plugging an app.

Like a pedal on a guitar, each control should be able to be assigned to a different function. How could the featured app affect the content?
