Sidequest Goals:

Create a sidequest component that is a "side" section of the page

What do I want to see as soon as I login in?
- My profile picture and a prompt to make or finish a quest depending on what I  have done so far
- query my time line, judge my progress, prmopt me to do something

What are some of things that I can make or model?

Can I create a short quest to go learn something with a quiz and some stats at the end?
