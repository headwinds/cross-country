## Headwinds Home

What do I want to achieve with my own home page?

- I'm a professional web developer with an eye for desgin and typically focus on frontend UI
- I want to work with analytics and collaborate with data scientists
- work within a service industry that cares about the environment and general welfare of people and the planet!
- I enjoy prototyping and gamification
- flexibility: since I'm not looking for work, my site could express more of my personality as ulimately it's nice to connect with people that enjoy sharing experiments
- currently my site is more of window than a bridge and I want to play more with RabbitMQ, Pusher, and emerging LLMs like Claude or Perplexity.

The home should include the common shell sections of the site like the header, footer, and navigation but also include a section for my blog, projects, and a network of friends. As well as something secret; something to discover; an Easter egg to unlock!

- header with auth
- navigation
- blog
- projects
- network
- secret
- footer

In the early days of the web, we had web rings and I really liked that concept of a small social cirlce.

I want to build something similar but more inspired by graph theory to build more of a networked fleet than a ring.
