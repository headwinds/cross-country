What do I want to achieve with my own home page?

* I'm a professional web developer with an eye for desgin and typically focus on frontend UI
* I want to work with analytics and collaborate with data scientists
* work within a service industry that cares about the environment
* I enjoy prototyping and gamification
* flexibility: since I'm not looking for work, my site could express more of my personality as ulimately it's nice to connect with people that enjoy sharing experiments
* currently my site is more of window than a bridge and I want to play more with RabbitMQ, Pusher, and emerging LLMs like ChatGpt.

In's the early days of the web, we had web rings. I want to build something similar but more inspired by graph theory to build more of a networked fleet than a ring.
