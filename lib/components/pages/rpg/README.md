# RPG and City/Country Life Simulation

what is a rpg simulation? I started a chat with perplexity about[stardew valley](https://www.perplexity.ai/search/what-genre-of-game-is-stardew-bdF1GNmcTyaCMzwkG4u1JQ#0) as it resembles the type of game play that I want to build and find its solo development by [Eric Barone aka ConcernedApe](https://www.gq.com/story/stardew-valley-eric-barone-profile) to be truly inspiring.
