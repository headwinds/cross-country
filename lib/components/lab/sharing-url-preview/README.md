### The Angeline Tetteh-Wayoe challenge

I tried to share a link The Block on Facebook but it was blocked because it's Canadian news content. 

From the following links, can I grab a title, image, and summary?

### PWA vs Native Sharing

Often I email myself links and I have to find my email from the list, so instead of doing that, I'd like to either use a mobile browser app (PWA) or react-native app. 

Flow

1. I find a link that I want to share and click their share button
2. My PWA or react-native app is present in the Share Via menu 
3. Click my app and I already have myself configure so that it send directly to my server and record is stored
