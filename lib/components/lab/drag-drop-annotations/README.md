### Vision

I think content creators would like the ability to mark up a photo (or video) with annoations and product links via a drag and drop interface.

The flow would be:
1. creator selects a photograph from their collection
1. uses drag and drop interface component to mark up image in draft mode
1. once finished, they should be able to publish the interactive photo 

- [prototype](coming soon)
