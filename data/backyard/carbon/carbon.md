### Question

what is the best carbon calculator?

### Answer

There are many carbon calculators available, and the "best" one depends on what you are looking for in a calculator. Here are a few options to consider:

Carbon Footprint: This is a comprehensive carbon calculator that takes into account your home energy use, transportation, diet, and shopping habits to calculate your carbon footprint. It also provides tips on how to reduce your carbon footprint.

Cool Climate Network: This carbon calculator is created by researchers at the University of California, Berkeley and helps you calculate your carbon footprint based on your household and transportation energy use, waste, and food consumption. It also provides tips on how to reduce your carbon footprint.

WWF Footprint Calculator: The World Wildlife Fund's Footprint Calculator takes into account your home energy use, transportation, food, and goods consumption to estimate your ecological footprint, which includes your carbon footprint as well as other environmental impacts.

Carbon Calculator by Carbon Independent: This calculator estimates your carbon emissions from your flights, and allows you to compare the emissions of different flight options, as well as offset your emissions by purchasing carbon credits.

It's important to note that different calculators may use different methodologies and data sources, which can lead to variations in the results. Therefore, it's a good idea to try a few different calculators and compare the results to get a better sense of your overall carbon footprint.

### Question

What carbon calculator would Oil & Gas companies use?

### Answer

Oil & Gas companies may use different carbon calculators depending on their specific needs and priorities. However, some of the commonly used carbon calculators by the industry include:

GHG Protocol: This is a widely recognized standard developed by the World Resources Institute (WRI) and the World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD). The GHG Protocol provides guidelines for companies to measure and report their greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, including carbon emissions, and is used by many large corporations in different sectors, including the oil and gas industry.

IPIECA Oil and Gas Industry Guidance on Voluntary Sustainability Reporting: The International Petroleum Industry Environmental Conservation Association (IPIECA) provides guidance on sustainability reporting for the oil and gas industry. The guidance includes a section on GHG emissions, which provides methods and standards for companies to measure and report their emissions.

The Oil and Gas Climate Initiative (OGCI): The OGCI is a group of major oil and gas companies that aims to reduce the industry's carbon emissions. The OGCI has developed a tool called the OGCI Carbon Intensity Metric, which helps member companies track and report their emissions intensity, as well as set targets for emissions reductions.

It's important to note that these calculators are intended for different purposes and may use different methodologies and data sources, which can lead to variations in the results. Additionally, some companies may choose to develop their own custom carbon calculators that are tailored to their specific operations and priorities.

### Question

Can I measure carbon emissions in my backyard and is there a carbon calculator for backyard measurement?

### Answer

It is possible to measure the carbon emissions from your backyard, but it would require specialized equipment and expertise. Carbon emissions from backyard activities such as burning wood, using a grill, or driving a lawnmower would be considered relatively small sources of emissions compared to larger sources like transportation or industrial processes.

There are no carbon calculators specifically designed for measuring carbon emissions from backyard activities. However, you could use a general carbon calculator, such as the ones I mentioned earlier, to estimate your household emissions, including emissions from backyard activities. These calculators typically include categories for home energy use, transportation, and food consumption, which would encompass most of the emissions associated with typical backyard activities.

In addition to using a carbon calculator, you can take steps to reduce your carbon footprint from backyard activities. For example, you could:

- Use an electric or push lawnmower instead of a gas-powered one
- Use a charcoal chimney starter instead of lighter fluid when grilling
- Use a compost bin for food waste instead of throwing it in the trash
- Use natural pest control methods instead of chemical pesticides
- Plant trees and other vegetation, which absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.

These small changes can add up to significant reductions in your overall carbon footprint.
