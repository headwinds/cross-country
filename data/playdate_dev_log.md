I started writing a game using Pulp - https://play.date/pulp/39818/edit/

I downloaded and installed the Playdate SDK. I had to search for it to discover it was installed in my Developer folder on my Mac.

brandonflowers > Developer > PlaydateSDK

The Playdate SDK comes with a simulator which is found within the the bin folder.

I thought about using [VS Code](https://devblog.cadinbatrack.com/2021/09/28/developing-for-playdate-in-vscode/) but I think I'll try [Nova](https://nova.app/) which seems to have a lot of support for Lua and makes it easy to run the Playdate Simulator.

By running the Playdate date in Nova, I was able to compile each of the examples game and run thenm in the simulator.
